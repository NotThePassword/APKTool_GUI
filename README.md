# APKTool_GUI
- A simple python GUI wrapper for APKTool.
- Uses preinstalled dependencies: tkinter, subprocess and threading.
- Created with the help of my local GLM-Z1-Rumination-32B model.
- You must use your own copy of APKTool. 
- The official JAR file can be acquired directly here: https://bitbucket.org/iBotPeaches/apktool/downloads/apktool_2.11.1.jar
- You can also visit the websites: https://apktool.org/ or https://github.com/iBotPeaches/Apktool
- This is a wrapper for an existing java project.
- I am not responsible for how anyone chooses to interact with APKTool.

### Note: You may or may not be familiar with the term "Vibe Coding". People with coding experience using AI to help them code. Well I want to introduce you to what I am calling "Jive Coding". That would be anyone with zero/minimal coding experience using AI to help them code. And I take that a step further by running it all locally using open-source models and no paid services. The goal was to teach myself how to prompt each model in the exact ways I needed for them to provide me the best results. This is a result of all the hard work I put into that, instead of just learning Python outright.
